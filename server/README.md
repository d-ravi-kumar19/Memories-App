# Memories Project - Server

This is the back-end codebase for the Memories project, a full-stack MERN application for managing memories. The server-side is built using Node.js and Express.

## Project Structure

The server directory contains the following structure:

- **controllers/**: Contains files that handle business logic for different routes.
- **index.js**: Main entry point of the Node.js application.
- **middleware/**: Contains middleware functions used in the application.
- **models/**: Contains Mongoose models for MongoDB.
- **node_modules/**: Contains Node.js dependencies for the Express application.
- **package.json**: Metadata about the Node.js application, including dependencies and scripts.
- **package-lock.json**: Locks the versions of dependencies used in the project.
- **public/**: May contain static assets served by the server.
- **routes/**: Contains route definitions for the application.

## Installation

To set up and run the server-side of the application:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `server` directory.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the server with `npm start`.

The Node.js server will typically be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
