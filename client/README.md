## Project Structure

The client directory contains the following structure:

- **node_modules/**: Contains Node.js dependencies for the React application.
- **package.json**: Metadata about the React application, including dependencies and scripts.
- **package-lock.json**: Locks the versions of dependencies used in the project.
- **public/**: Contains static assets and the `index.html` file for the React application.
- **src/**: Contains the source code of the React application, including components, services, and other files.

## Installation

To set up and run the client-side of the application:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.

The React application will typically be running on `http://localhost:3000`.
